I recently successfully completed the GIAC GCIH certification. This certification was an awesome experience and it helped me bolster my knowledge about several facets of IT Security.

If you are looking to learn more about:

* the incident response process,
* current tools used by cyber criminals,
* or defenses against common attacks occurring today,

then this certification and its material are right for you. I have taken a significant amount of certifications over the last few years (almost 20 in all), and I feel that this one was as beneficial to me from a technical standpoint as the CISSP.

While this certification is quite expensive, I feel it will provide me with a significant return on investment. You can also sign up for the courses and their associated certifications on the <a href="https://www.sans.edu">sans.edu</a> website at a discounted rate for up to two of their courses.

I am now eagerly anticipating the arrival of my books for my next GIAC certification, the GPEN.
