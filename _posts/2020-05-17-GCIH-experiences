I recently successfully completed the GIAC GCIH certification. This certification was an awesome experience and it helped me learn more in depth about several additional facets of IT Security.

If you are looking to learn more about:

* the incident response process,
* current tools used by cyber criminals,
* or defenses against common attacks occurring today,

then this certification and its material are right for you. I have taken a significant amount of certifications over the last few years (almost 20 in all), and I feel that this one was as beneficial to me from a technical standpoint as the CISSP.

I am now eagerly anticipating the arrival of my books for my next GIAC certification, the GPEN.
