<center># About Me</center>

I am a seasoned systems administrator with exposure to a wide breadth of information technology platforms including Windows Server, Linux, AIX, and Citrix. I also have experience in automating over 250 processes at my current employer, and am heavily involved with project and vendor management.

Recently, I have started to transition over to more of a security focus in my role, which I greatly enjoy. I am looking to further my skills to become a seasoned cybersecurity professional.
